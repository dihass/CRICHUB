          <p>
            Sangakkara was born in Matale, Central Province, near the city of
            Kandy, in 1977. He grew up in Kandy with three siblings and his
            parents. Sangakkara received his education at Trinity College,
            Kandy. During his school days, he was a chorister and played the
            violin.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Sangakkara excelled in many sports, and his college principal
            encouraged him to focus on cricket. He represented his school's
            Under-13, Under-15, Under-17, Under-19 and first XI squads and was
            awarded his school's The Trinity Lion award and Ryde Gold Medal.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            He got selected to represent Sri Lanka A cricket team's tour to
            South Africa in 1999â€“00. His knock of an unbeaten 156 against the
            Zimbabwe A team during a one-day match helped him secure a place in
            the Sri Lankan national cricket team later that year.

          <p>
            Sanga was the Senior Prefect (Head Boy) of school and entered the
            Law Faculty of the University of Colombo, but he was unable to
            finish his degree initially due to his cricketing commitments. He
            later completed his master's degree in law from the university. His
            parents sheltered Tamil families during the Black July riots in
            1983.

            At the age of 22, Kumar Sangakkara made his Test debut for Sri Lanka
            against South Africa in July 2000. Two weeks before, he had already
            played his first ODI. In the Singer Triangular Series in 2000, he
            scored 85 runs against South Africa and won his first man of the
            match award. He scored 199 runs to wrap up the series, ensuring his
            spot in the following Test series against South Africa. He was
            removed twice in the 1990s before scoring his first Test century,
            once against South Africa and once against England. In the opening
            game against India in August 2001, he produced his first century,
            paving the way for Sri Lanka to win by 10 wickets.

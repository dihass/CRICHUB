        <h1>MS Dhoni's Childhood, Upbringing, and Cricket Career</h1>
        <ul class="intro">
            <li><p>Mahendra Singh Dhoni, better known by his stage name MS Dhoni, was born in Ranchi, India, on July 7, 1981. He played as a wicket-keeper for the Indian national cricket team from 2007 to 2017 and from 2008 to 2014 in Test matches. Moreover, he serves as Chennai Super Kings' current captain in the Indian Premier League.</p></li>
            <li><p>In 2004, Dhoni made his debut abroad. In his fifth international game against Pakistan, he showcased his bat skills with a 148-run innings. He reached the India Test team within a year, when he made a name for himself by scoring a century (100 runs or more in a single innings) against Pakistan.</p></li>
            <li><p>Dhoni assumed leadership of the one-day team in 2007 despite having little experience and guided India to the Twenty20 (T20) global championship. In December 2009, among other things, series victories over Australia and Sri Lanka propelled India to the top of the International Cricket Council (ICC) Test rankings for the first time. In 2008 and 2009, Dhoni received the ICC One Day International Player of the Year Award for his performance.</p></li>
            <li><p>Dhoni's brisk 91-run performance in front of a home crowd in Mumbai during the 2011 one-day World Cup helped India defeat Sri Lanka in the championship match. Also, he helped India get to the 2015 Cricket World Cup semifinals. Having captained India in 331 international games, the most by a captain in the history of the game, Dhoni retired from captaincy in 2017. He left international competition three years later.</p></li>
            <li><p>Dhoni is a right-handed wicketkeeper batsman who is regarded as one of the top finishers in the game. He is renowned for his cool leadership style and his capacity to win games in tense circumstances.<p></p>
